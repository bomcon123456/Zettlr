- **Eau Fraiche**. The most diluted version of fragrance, usually with 1-3% perfume oil in alcohol and water. Usually **lasts for less than an hour. **
- **Cologne**(_Eau de Cologne_). Oldest term for perfume, used in North America for masculine scents. Light, fresh, and fruity, typically composed of 2-4% perfume oils in alcohol and water. Tends to be used in fragrances for younger people. Usually **lasts for about 2 hours**.
- **Toilette** (_Eau de Toilette_). A light spray composition with 5-15% pure perfume essence dissolved in alcohol. Usually **lasts for about 3 hours.**
- **Perfume**(_Eau de Parfum_). Historically genderless, used to describe both men’s and women’s products, and is the best term for describing a fragrance. (I’ll be using cologne more in this post though, simply because that’s the term most readers associate with fragrance.) Contains 15-20% pure perfume essence and **lasts for about 5 to 8 hours**
-  **Parfum**. A corruption of the Latin phrase _per fumum_ (through smoke). The most concentrated and expensive of all fragrance options. Slightly oilier, _parfum_ (or perfume; you can see how these terms get confusing!) is composed of 20-30% pure perfume essence. A single application can **last up to 24 hours. **

Other terms
**Sillage** (pronounced “see-yazh”) is a French term that describes the ability of a scent to be smelled at a distance; the bigger the distance, the stronger sillage is. It is the “trail” that the scent leaves as you move, sometimes referred to as "the sense of a person being present in the room after he or she has left".


**Projection** is sort of like your personal perfume cloud or aura — how far from your skin the perfume projects when you are standing still.


**Longevity**, on the other hand, refers to how long a fragrance lasts on your skin once applied. Important to note here that due to evaporation, alcohol content and a number of other factors, a fragrance will smell slightly different over time, and this is part of the longevity factor as well.
