   - **Spray perfume on dry skin**, preferably right after a shower. Hold the spray nozzle 3-6 inches from your skin while applying.
   - **Start light**. If you’re new to wearing fragrances, start with one single spray on your chest. As you become more comfortable and knowledgeable about how to wear cologne properly, you can branch out to a few more sprays in different areas…
   - **Apply fragrance to heat areas**. Your body heat will push the scent throughout the day, creating a nice scent trail commonly called sillage. **Start with the warmest parts of your body**: chest, neck, lower jaw, wrist, forearm, inner elbow, shoulder. Do not spray on all these points at the same time; start with one and then as you learn the scent, spray 2-3 other spots.
   - **Re-spray only when required**. You can add more sprays to your wrists  depending on how long the scent lasts. For most this will be in the second half of the day.
   - **Don’t kill the note**. Rubbing the perfume into the skin seems a sensible thing to do. In reality, it breaks the molecular bond, making the scent weaker.
   - **Don’t spray and walk**. Spraying a fragrance in the air and walking through the mist is worthless. Most of the fragrance drops straight to the floor.
   - **Don’t spray fragrance on your clothes**. In this case the fragrance isn’t allowed to mix with your oils, and hence it can’t naturally go through the stages of notes like it should. Also, the oils in a fragrance will stain many fabrics.
   - **Don’t splash**. If you are applying cologne from a regular bottle, take one finger and press it against the opening of your bottle and then tip it over gently.  Dab onto the parts of the body described above.
   - **Less is more**. Fragrance should be discovered, not announced. People who are close by should be able to smell your cologne, but not be overpowered by it.
